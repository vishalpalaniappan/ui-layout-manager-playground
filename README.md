# ui-layout-manager-playground
A playground to explore the usage of ui-layout-manager library in a stand alone application.

Link to [demo](https://vishalpalaniappan.github.io/ui-layout-manager-playground/). 

I will update this link as I keep adding features to the open PR to demo it and then after it is ready, I will update this readme with all the relevant information. Also, the components aren't connected yet, its just a demo of the layout. I will also use this playground to document my preferred approach for handling more complex state management in React and document it so I can refer to it when developing my applications.
