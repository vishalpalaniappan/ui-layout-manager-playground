# ui-layout-manager-playground
A playground to explore the usage of ui-layout-manager library in a stand alone application.

Link to [demo](https://vishalpalaniappan.github.io/ui-layout-manager-playground/). 

I will update this link as I keep adding features to the open PR if people want to try it easily and then after it is ready, I will update this readme with all the relevant information.
